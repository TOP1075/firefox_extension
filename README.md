# **FIREFOX EXTENSION**

## **Overview**
A super simple Firefox extension to make two minor modifications to Firefox behaviour, as follows:
1. when saving a bookmark via right-click > "Add bookmark...", populate the add bookmark window with the currently-open tab (this mirrors Chrome behaviour)
2. when opening multiple links - e.g. via highlighting a list of links in a spreadsheet then right-click > "Open links" - open them in from "top to bottom" (current behaviour is "bottom to top")

This is also an initial attempt at a git-managed project.
