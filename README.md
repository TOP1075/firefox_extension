# **FIREFOX EXTENSION**

## **Overview**
A super simple Firefox extension to make one minor modifications to Firefox behaviour, as follows:
1. when saving a bookmark via right-click > "Add bookmark...", populate the add bookmark window with the currently-open tab (this mirrors Chrome behaviour)

## **Further updates**
- consider using "permissions": ["activeTab"]," given the extension will be non-functional on non-active tabs
